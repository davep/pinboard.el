## Commentary:

`pinboard.el` is an Emacs client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/).

To get started, visit [your password settings
page](https://pinboard.in/settings/password) on Pinboard and get the API
token that's displayed there. Then edit `~/.authinfo` and add a line like
this:

```
machine api.pinboard.in password foo:8ar8a5w188l3
```

Once done, you can <kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>pinboard</kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd> and
browse your pins. Current commands available include:

## Org support

[Konrad Hinsen](https://gist.github.com/khinsen) has [written a handy little
add-on](https://github.com/davep/pinboard.el/issues/8) that connects
`pinboard` with `org-mode`, by providing an easy method of pulling a link
out of `pinboard` and getting it into `org-mode`. See [the gist he wrote for
the code](https://gist.github.com/khinsen/7ed357eed9b27f142e4fa6f5c4ad45dd).

## Troubleshooting

### `pinboard.el` doesn't find API token despite it being set in `.authinfo`

Check the variable `auth-sources` to ensure that Emacs is looking for
`.authinfo`. Some Emacs-frameworks set their own default (typically
enforcing gpg encryption).

If you're using `use-package`, you can append the `~/.authinfo` file to
the `auth-sources` list like this:

```elisp
(use-package pinboard :config (add-to-list 'auth-sources "~/.authinfo" t))
```

## TODO

Please see [the GitHub issues
list](https://github.com/davep/pinboard.el/issues) for things I plan to do.
