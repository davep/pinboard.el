;;; Commentary:
;;
;; pinboard.el provides an Emacs client for pinboard.in.
;;
;; To get started, visit your password settings page
;; (https://pinboard.in/settings/password) on Pinboard and get the API token
;; that's displayed there. Then edit ~/.authinfo and add a line like this:
;;
;; machine api.pinboard.in password foo:8ar8a5w188l3
;;
;; Once done, you can M-x pinboard RET and browse your pins. A number of
;; commands are available when viewing the pin list, press "?" or see the
;; "Pinboard" menu for more information.
;;
;; Commands available that aren't part of the pin list, and that you might
;; want to bind to keys, include:
;;
;; | Command                | Description                           |
;; | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
;; | pinboard               | Open the Pinboard pin list            |
;; | pinboard-add           | Add a new pin to Pinboard             |
;; | pinboard-add-for-later | Prompt for a URL and add it for later |
